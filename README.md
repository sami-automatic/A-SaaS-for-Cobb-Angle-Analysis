# A-SaaS-for-Cobb-Angle-Analysis

## About

Many radiologists have access to toolboxes where they can interactively mark Roentgen images
and make calculations for anomalies by default in their workstations, however those tools are
time consuming and lack intuitiveness. This project aims to reduce practiotioner's time and effort to examine roentgen images.

> This is a prototype of a SaaS, where a user practitioner can just types the domain name to the browser, drags and drops the roentgen image instead of installing any third party program.

## Automatic calculation

> The user, like in a regular workstation, can draw straight lines but does not
> need to calculate angles between them manually. Users can just choose as many potential
> endplates as they want and draw straight lines. The SaaS calculates all the angle combinations
> automatically and visualizes the selected two lines. The angle is then printed in the screen.
> Since the evaluation will be made on the same platform even if the doctor or facility
> changes, monitoring the patient's progress will be more consistent.
